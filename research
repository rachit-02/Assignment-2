Using Machine Learning to Predict Happiness Scores: A Comparative Analysis of Regressors
Abstract
This study explores the application of machine learning models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression (SVR)—to predict happiness scores from socio-economic indicators provided by the World Happiness Report 2024 dataset. Data preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling and cross-validation, were utilized for robust analysis. Gradient Boosting emerged as the best-performing model with an R² score of 0.9425 on the test set, followed by SVR and Random Forest. The study highlights the importance of advanced machine learning in understanding socio-economic dynamics and provides insights for future research in this domain.

1. Introduction
Happiness, as a societal metric, has gained increasing importance for policy-making and governance. The World Happiness Report quantifies happiness using the Ladder score, derived from metrics such as GDP per capita, social support, and health expectancy. However, the interplay of these factors is complex and not easily decipherable with traditional statistical methods. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative for modeling such relationships.

This research focuses on using ML models to predict happiness scores based on multiple predictors. The study compares the performance of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVR, aiming to identify the best approach for predictive accuracy and generalization.

2. Data and Preprocessing
2.1 Dataset Description
The dataset, sourced from the World Happiness Report 2024, comprises 10 features including GDP per capita, social support, and perceptions of corruption. The target variable is the "Ladder score," a numerical representation of happiness.

2.2 Preprocessing Steps
Handling Missing Values: Rows with missing data were removed to ensure consistency.
Feature Scaling: Features were standardized using StandardScaler to normalize ranges, aiding in optimizing model performance.
SMOTE Evaluation: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was evaluated for balancing data. However, due to the continuous nature of the target variable, it was deemed inapplicable.
Data Splitting: The data was divided into training (80%) and test (20%) sets using train_test_split.
2.3 Tools and Frameworks
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib.
Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVR.
3. Methodology
3.1 Model Selection
Three models were chosen based on their popularity and effectiveness in regression tasks:

Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method leveraging multiple decision trees for robust predictions.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: A sequential ensemble model optimizing errors iteratively.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): A kernel-based method capable of capturing complex relationships.
3.2 Cross-Validation
K-Fold Cross-Validation (K=5) was employed to ensure generalization and minimize overfitting. Negative Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used as the evaluation metric during cross-validation.

3.3 Evaluation Metrics
Models were evaluated on the test set using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
R² Score: Proportion of variance explained by the model.
4. Results and Analysis
4.1 Cross-Validation Performance
Model	Cross-Validation MSE
Random Forest	0.1681
Gradient Boosting	0.0998
SVM	0.1698
Gradient Boosting demonstrated superior cross-validation performance, suggesting its effectiveness in capturing intricate patterns in the data.

4.2 Test Set Evaluation
Model	Test MSE	Test MAE	Test R²
Random Forest	0.1582	0.2742	0.8945
Gradient Boosting	0.0862	0.2255	0.9425
SVM	0.1047	0.1538	0.9301
Gradient Boosting achieved the highest R² score, followed closely by SVR. Random Forest, while effective, lagged slightly in predictive accuracy.

4.3 Visualization
Plots of predicted vs. true values revealed strong correlations for all models, with Gradient Boosting producing the most accurate predictions. Below is a representative visualization for Gradient Boosting:

4.4 Feature Importance
Feature importance analysis (using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) revealed GDP per capita, social support, and health expectancy as the most significant predictors.

5. Discussion
5.1 Performance Analysis
Gradient Boosting consistently outperformed other models due to its iterative learning mechanism. SVR's kernel approach provided competitive accuracy but required more computational resources. Random Forest, though robust, was less sensitive to subtle variations in feature interactions.

5.2 Implications
The study underscores the importance of tree-based and kernel-based methods for modeling socio-economic data. Predicting happiness scores with high accuracy can assist policymakers in identifying critical factors for improving societal well-being.

5.3 Limitations
Interpretability: Despite accuracy, the models lack inherent interpretability. Techniques like SHAP or LIME could address this in future work.
Dataset Size: Limited data points may restrict generalization. Larger datasets could improve model reliability.
6. Conclusion and Future Work
This research highlights the potential of machine learning models in predicting happiness metrics. Gradient Boosting, with its superior performance, is recommended for similar regression tasks. Future studies should explore:

Explainable AI (XAI): Integrating SHAP or LIME for better interpretability.
Deep Learning: Testing neural networks for larger datasets.
Policy Insights: Collaborating with social scientists to derive actionable insights.
